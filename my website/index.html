              <section calss="subheading">
              <p>
                My journey to become a web developer has been a challenging and rewarding experience. When I first started out, I knew nothing about coding or web development. However, with dedication and hard work, I have been able to learn a great deal and become proficient in various programming languages, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
 One of the most interesting aspects of my journey has been learning about web design and user experience. I have discovered that creating an effective website requires not only technical skills but also a strong understanding of how people use the web and what they expect from a website. I have enjoyed learning about the importance of responsive design, accessibility, and usability, and how these factors can greatly impact the success of a website. Another thing I have learned is the importance of staying up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in web development. The industry is constantly evolving, and it is crucial to stay informed about new tools, frameworks, and techniques that can enhance the development process and improve the user experience.
